# vk7dik_watch

### What is this?
A lightweight Python script that monitors the online/offline status of amateur radio callsigns by checking the QRZ *OnAirLogbook* banner.  

It logs results on every run and sends a **Pushover** notification whenever the station transitions from **OFFLINE â†’ ONLINE** (with a 2-hour cooldown to prevent spam).  

By default, this script is set up for **VK7DIK**, but you can easily change the callsign in the config section. If you want to track multiple callsigns, make a copy of the script for each one and run them separately from `crontab`.

## This script is designed to let you know when your mates are on air and feeling sociable.  (if they are not, they will not update their status)

## Why Pushover?
Pushover is a simple, reliable push notification service that delivers alerts straight to your phone, tablet, or desktop.  

Compared to traditional channels like **SMS, email, or carrier TXT**, Pushover has some big advantages:
- **Instant delivery** â€” no carrier delays or spam filters.  
- **Cross-platform** â€” iOS, Android, and desktop clients available.  
- **Configurable** â€” custom sounds, priorities, and quiet hours.  
- **Reliable** â€” works anywhere you have internet.  

For hobby projects like this one, Pushover is perfect: if your mate comes online at 3 am, youâ€™ll know instantly.

## How it works
- Fetches the OnAirLogbook iframe directly:  
  `https://www.onairlogbook.com/qrz-onairlogbook-display-on-air-now.php?callsign=<callsign>`
- Classifies status:
  - If the offline banner text is present â†’ **OFFLINE**  
  - Otherwise â†’ **ONLINE**
- Logs every run to `vk7dik_watch.log`  
- Maintains state in `vk7dik_watch.json` (last status + last notify timestamp)  
- Sends a **Pushover** alert only on **OFFLINE â†’ ONLINE** transitions (with 2-hour cooldown).

## Files
- `vk7dik_watch.py` â€” the watcher script  
- `vk7dik_watch.log` â€” rolling log of status checks  
- `vk7dik_watch.json` â€” state tracking

## Setup

Copy vk7dik_watch.py into your server directory (e.g. /home/bitnami/VK7DIK/).

Make it executable:

chmod +x /home/bitnami/VK7DIK/vk7dik_watch.py

Edit the script to update the CALLSIGN value in the config section.

To monitor multiple callsigns, duplicate the script (e.g. vk2abc_watch.py) and set a different callsign in each file.

Add a cron job to run the script every 5 minutes:

*/5 * * * * /home/bitnami/VK7DIK/vk7dik_watch.py



## Example log entries

Every run appends one line to vk7dik_watch.log. When status changes from OFFLINE â†’ ONLINE, extra alert lines are logged.
